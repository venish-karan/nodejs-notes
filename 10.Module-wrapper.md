# Module Wrapper
1. Every module in node.js gets wrapped in an IIFE before being loaded
2. IIFE helps keep top-level variables scoped to the module rather than the global object.
3. The IIFE that wraps every module contains 5 parameters which are pretty important for the functioning of a module.

(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  const superHero = "Batman";
  console.log(superHero);
})()

When Node.js loads a module, it wraps the module code inside a function (an IIFE) and injects these parameters—exports, 
require, module, __filename, and __dirname—by passing them as arguments to this wrapper function. 
They are not globally or magically imported but explicitly provided to each module in this way, 
enabling modularization and access to module-specific information and functionality.
