# Importing JSON and Watch mode

1. JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation.
```
{
  name: "qwerty",
  address: {
    city: chennai,
  },
}

// main.js
const data = require("./data.json")
console.log(data) // prints the above json object
```
2. It is recommended to use .json extension while import because node.js trys to search .js extension 1st then json extension.


# Watch mode

1. It is used to print results from a file in console when we save file.
```
node --watch index.js
```
