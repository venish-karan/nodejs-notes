# Callbacks
1. In JavaScript, functions are first class objects
2. A function can be passed as an argument to a function
3. A function can also be returned as values from other functions
4. A function that takes function as an argument and returns it are called as higher order function
5. A function that is passed as an argument are called as callback function.
6. 2 types of callback functions:
   - Synchronous callbacks -> _A callback which is executed immediately is called a synchronous callback_
        let numbers = [1,3,2]
        numbers. sort( (a, b) => a-b)
        numbers. filter (n => n%2 === 0)
        numbers.map(n => n \ 2)
   - Asynchronous callbacks
        o. A callback that is often used to continue or resume code execution after an
        asynchronous operation has completed
        o. Callbacks are used to delay the execution of a function until a particular time or
        event has occurred
        o. Node.js have an asynchronous nature to prevent blocking of execution
        Ex: reading data from a file, fetching data from a database or handling a network
        request
   - Asynchronous callbacks in browser
      o. EventListener for click action, callback function is delayed till click action occurs
      o. for fetch callbacks are delayed till data is fetched from server.
