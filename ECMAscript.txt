Ecma International:
  1. In Nov 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International
  2. It is an industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and
     communication systems
  3. Netscape wanted a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform
     to as it would help keep other implementations consistent across browsers
  4. For each new specification Ecma provides a standard specification and a
     committee
  5. In case of JavaScript, the standard is called ECMA-262 and the committee that
     works on ECMA-262 is called Technical Committee 39 (TC39)
  6. Ecma however decided to use the term "ECMAScript" to talk about the official
     language
  7. The reason for this is because Oracle (who acquired Microsystems) owns the
     trademark for the term "JavaScript"
  8. ECMAScript refers to the standard language whereas JavaScript is what we use
     in practice and builds on top of ECMAScript

ECMAScript versions:
  1997 - ECMAScript 1
  1998 - ECMAScript 2
  1999 - ECMAScript 3
  ECMAScript 4 never released
  2009 - ECMAScript 5
  2015 - ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
  One version every year since 2015

ECMAScript Summary:
  ECMA-262 is the language specification
  ECMAScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
  JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds on top of that
