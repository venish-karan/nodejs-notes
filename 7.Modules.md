# Modules
1. A module is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has its own context
2. **In Node.js, each file is treated as a separate module**
3. Types of Modules
  - Local modules - Modules that we create in our application
  - Built-in modules - Modules that Node.js ships with out of the box
  - Third party modules - Modules written by other developers that we can use in our application

# CommonJS
1. **CommonJS is a standard that states how a module should be structured and shared**
2. Node.js adopted CommonJS when it started out and is what you will see in code bases
