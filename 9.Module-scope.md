# Module Scope Summary
1. Each loaded module in Node.js is wrapped with an IIFE that provides private scoping of code
2. IIFE allows you to repeat variable or function names without any conflicts.

# Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) in Node.js

(function() {
// module code actually lives in here
})()

1. Before a module's code is executed, Node.js will wrap it with a function wrapper that provides module scope
2. This saves us from having to worry about conflicting variables or functions
3. There is proper encapsulation and reusability is unaffected.
