# ES Modules
1. At the time Node.js was created, there was no built-in module system in JavaScript
2. Node.js defaulted to CommonJS as its module system
3. As of ES2015, JavaScript does have a standardized module system as part of the language itself
4. That module system is called EcmaScript Modules or ES Modules or ESM for short.

1. .mjs is the extension for es modules.
2. using import keyword modules are imported.
