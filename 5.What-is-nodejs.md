2. It is not a language, it is not a framework
3. Capable of executing JavaScript code outside a browser
4. It can execute not only the standard ECMAScript language but also new features that are made available through C++ bindings using the V8 engine
5. It consists of C++ files which form the core features and JavaScript files which expose common utilities and some of the C++ features for easier consumption.

# What can you build with Node.js ?
1.Traditional websites
2. Backend services like APIs
3. Real-time applications
4. Streaming services
5. CLI tools
6. Multiplayer games
(Node.js allows you to build complex and powerful applications)

- Node.js is open source runtime environment for javascript, so we can see the code for nodejs in github.
- Go to deps/ folder, we can see all the dependencies like **v8, libuv, zlib, crypto, etc** that is used to run javascript code, it can be said as one of the components in javascript runtime enviroment.

- src/ folder has the c++ code that is used in javascript runtime to access the low level functionality.
- Javascript was not designed to handle the low level functionality where as c++ was designed to do that, ex: database connection, network operation, file handling, etc.
- C/C++ is also one of the component in javascript runtime environment.
- lib/ folder has javascript code to access the c++ features like fs.js which is a file system module for handling files.
