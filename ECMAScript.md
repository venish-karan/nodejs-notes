# ECMAScript Summary

1. ECMA-262 is the language specification
2. ECMAScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
3. JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds on top of that

# Going back in time...

1. In 1993, the first web browser with a user interface called Mosaic was released
2. In 1994, the lead developers of Mosaic founded a company called Netscape and
3. released a more polished browser called Netscape Navigator
Web pages could only be static and there was no interactivity after a page was loaded
4. In 1995, Netscape created a new scripting language called JavaScript
5. The name was purely for marketing purpose as Java was the hot new language back then.

# The Advent of Microsoft

1. In 1995, Microsoft debuted their browser Internet Explorer. 
Microsoft realized that JavaScript fundamentally changed the user experience of the web and wanted the same for Internet Explorer.
2. However, there was no specification for them to follow.
In 1996, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own scripting language called JScript.
The differences between JavaScript and JScript made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers.
3. "Best viewed in Netscape" and "Best viewed in Internet Explorer" badges became common on websites.

# Ecma International

1. In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, an industry association dedicated to standardizing information and communication systems.
2. Netscape wanted a standard specification that all browser vendors could follow, which would help ensure consistent implementations across browsers.
3. For each new specification, Ecma provides a standard and establishes a committee. For JavaScript, the standard is called ECMA-262, and the committee responsible for it is Technical Committee 39 (TC39).
4. Ecma decided to use the term "ECMAScript" for the official language specification. This decision was made because Oracle (which acquired Sun Microsystems) owns the trademark for the term "JavaScript." ECMAScript refers to the standard language, whereas JavaScript is what we use in practice and builds on top of ECMAScript.
