1. Node REPL (Interactive shell to run nodejs expression - Javascript)
   - Read
   - Evaluate
   - Print
   - Loop

2. Browser vs Node.js
  - In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies. You don't have the document, window and
  all the other objects that are provided by the browser in node.
  - In the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules. For example the filesystem access functionality.
  - With Node.js, you control the environment.
  - With a browser, you are at the mercy of what the users choose, if user chooses internet explorer you have to do more work to account for that.
